                    The Foundation Team proudly presents our City-State Design, submitted to the Mars Society for the 2020 Mars City-State Design Contest. We are an amateur team from different backgrounds, but we are passionate about Mars, so we worked hard since the contest announcement, and produced a lot of material, especially beautiful pictures. But a twenty pages report is really short, and we had hard times making the selection. This website is dedicated to show whate we couldn't show in the report. Please enjoy it, and inspiring pictures from a possible Mars.

                    As all human communities, people in Foundation have developed their own expressions and words. Here are a few of the most famous ones, enjoy typical Mars flavor !<br><br>

                    <strong style="text-decoration : underline 2px">Albator:</strong> a Single-Stage-To-Orbit vehicle built on Mars. This name is derived from the first series of them, namely the X33M “Albatrosses”. Some says this word is related to the French name of a fictional character of the 20th century fighting for liberty, but the link is very tenuous.<br><br>

                    <strong style="text-decoration : underline 2px">Ecopoiesis:</strong> neologism founded by R. Haynes, from the ancient Greek οικος, house, and ποιησις , production.<br><br>

                    <strong style="text-decoration : underline 2px">Mattdams:</strong> potatoes.<br><br>

                    <strong style="text-decoration : underline 2px">Methanox:</strong> on Earth, oxygen is readily available to burn fuel, so people only speak about ‘fuel’. On Mars, it’s not the case, and filling the tank of a vehicle means filling both fuel and oxidizer. Methanox is the most used of them, and designates the couple made of methane and oxygen. It should be distinguished from methalox, typical rocket fuel, in which oxygen is specifically liquid.<br><br>

                    <strong style="text-decoration : underline 2px">Red Helmets:</strong> name of the firemen trained and equipped by each City-State, always ready to take action in case of emergency on Mars. The organization is managed by the Congress of Mars.<br><br>
                    
                    <strong style="text-decoration : underline 2px">Areshield</strong>: from the brand 300M “AresShield“, the ubiquitous glass developed specifically to make the transparent sections of the urban and greenhouse tubes..
